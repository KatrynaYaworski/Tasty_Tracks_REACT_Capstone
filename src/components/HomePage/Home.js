          <h2 id="section2">What are Macros (IIFYM) or Macronutrients?</h2>
          <p>
          Macronutrients, commonly known as macros, are fundamental biochemical compounds that constitute a significant portion of your diet. These essential nutrients play a vital role in various physiological processes within the body.
          </p>
          <p>
          For your body to function optimally and maintain overall well-being, it requires a consistent intake of these macronutrients. They serve as the building blocks for energy production and support the body's maintenance and growth.
          </p>
          <p>
          A balanced and thoughtful approach to your diet is crucial for sustaining good health. The primary macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, each contributing uniquely to your nutritional needs. Embracing a well-rounded diet plan ensures that you meet these essential requirements for a healthier and more vibrant life.

          <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
          <p>
          Carbohydrates are macromolecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They play a crucial role in supporting the proper functioning of both the mind and body. These macronutrients are a vital component of our diet, providing essential energy for various bodily functions.

          <p>
          Carbohydrates are found abundantly in fruits, vegetables, milk, honey, and sugary juices. They serve as the primary energy source due to their numerous benefits for different parts of the body.
          </p>
          <p>
          Carbs contribute to cellular respiration, where glucose, a carbohydrate, is used to produce ATPâ€”the energy currency of the body. Adequate fiber intake, whether soluble or insoluble, promotes proper bowel function and helps prevent digestive tract diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
          Moreover, carbohydrates provide immediate energy to the entire body, making them an essential component of a balanced and energizing diet.
          </p>

          <h3>Proteins</h3>
          <p>
          Proteins are macronutrients formed through the polymerization of amino acids, where amino acids are linked together in long chains to create protein molecules. The structure of proteins includes hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen.

          Out of the 20 amino acids, 9 are essential, meaning the body cannot produce them and must obtain them from various sources to meet its protein requirements. These essential amino acids are found in animal meats such as chicken, fish, mutton, and beef, as well as in grains, legumes, and similar food sources.
          </p>
          <p>
          Proteins play a crucial role in the body, constituting about 16-20% of the body's composition, with cells being based on protein material. They serve various essential functions:
          </p>
          <li>Proteins contribute to the growth and maintenance of the body, aiding in the development of muscles and tissues.</li>
         <li>Increased protein intake is recommended during periods of injury or pregnancy to support recovery.</li>
         <li>Proteins act as hormones, including testosterone, insulin, and other vital hormones that facilitate communication between cells throughout the body.</li>
          <li>In the form of enzymes, proteins catalyze biochemical reactions, enhancing the speed of the body's metabolism. These reactions are involved in processes such as digestion, blood clotting, and energy synthesis.</li>
          <li>Proteins contribute to the structural integrity of the body; components like bones, tendons, and ligaments contain proteins.</li>

          <h3>Fats</h3>
          <p>
          Fats consist of lipids containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These lipids are long-chain polymers of fatty acids, and based on the presence of double bonds, fats can be categorized as saturated or unsaturated.

          <p>
          Saturated fats are solid at room temperature and are commonly found in foods derived from butter, cheese, and dairy products. Additionally, they are present in certain oils like palm oil and coconut oil.
          </p>
          <p>
          Trans fats are artificially created through the hydrogenation of oils to solidify them. These fats are considered detrimental to health as they raise cholesterol levels.
          </p>
          <p>
          Unsaturated fats are considered healthier for dietary purposes. They remain in a liquid state at room temperature, avoiding the clogging of veins and preventing increases in blood pressure and cholesterol. Examples of unsaturated fats include sunflower oil, canola oil, and olive oil.
          </p>
          <p>
          Fats play essential roles in development and serve as an energy source for the brain. They are also utilized to store fat-soluble vitamins A, E, D, and K in fat tissues. Additionally, fats provide insulation to the body against temperature extremes.
